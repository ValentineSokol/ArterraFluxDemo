# ArterraFluxDemo
The adaptation of a Flux demo for Arterra.
# Important Notes:
1) Please note that all markets are stored locally, so you will need to create them in order to use the app.
1) I made the Admin Panel accessible for any signed in user just for convenient testing.
2) the "Delete" button in an admin panel just deletes market id from localStorage. The real app does not need to delete Flux markets.
